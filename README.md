# EzInliner
The most basic of basic text parsing (Doubles up as me doing "Hello World" here). I whipped this up to convert G/HLSL shader files to an inline string format so I could dump them into demo frameworks.

IN: Text file
OUT: Text file w/ lines contained in ""

Instructions:
Build and drag files to be converted onto the .exe, EzInliner will spit out inline[n].txt files to the same directory as the original read files
